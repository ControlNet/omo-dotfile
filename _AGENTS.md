## Rules

- Code/comments/identifiers in English. Reply in the user’s language unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- When giving terminal steps, always include copy-pastable CLI commands.
- Never include secrets/tokens/keys in code, logs, docs, or gists. Assume public by default; use env vars and mention .gitignore/.env.local.
- Prefer minimal, reviewable patches; avoid large refactors unless asked.
- For non-trivial changes: include exact verification commands (lint/test/run) and expected outcome/signals (what should pass / what to look for).
- Warn before any destructive action (delete/overwrite/migration/force push).
- Only modify project-level AGENTS.md when explicitly asked to change project rules.
